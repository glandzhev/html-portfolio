    <h2>Skills:</h2>
    <p>Organizational skills - refer to my ability to stay focused on different tasks and use my time,
     energy, strength, and mental capacity in order to achieve the desired outcome. Creative thinking 
     described as “Thinking outside the box” is the ability to invent and/or create something new: be 
     that a concept, a solution, a method, a work of art, or an actual, physical device. Problem-solving 
     skills consist of two main components: Identifying the problem and Deciding on the best solution. 
     Each of them is as important as the other. In life as much as in work, it's important to know how 
     to provide and receive feedback from others.</p>
